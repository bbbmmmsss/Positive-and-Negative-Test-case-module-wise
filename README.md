**write 4 positive and 4 negative test cases on mobile phone brightness functionality**
*Positive Test Cases for Mobile Phone Brightness:
1. Increase Brightness to Maximum: Verify that the brightness slider can be increased to the maximum level, and the screen adjusts accordingly.
2. Decrease Brightness to Minimum: Verify that the brightness slider can be decreased to the minimum level (without turning off the display), and the screen dims appropriately.
3. Auto-Brightness Functionality: Test that auto-brightness works as expected, adjusting the brightness based on ambient lighting conditions.
4. Incremental Brightness Adjustment: Verify that the brightness adjusts smoothly and correctly when the user slides the brightness bar to different levels.

*Negative Test Cases for Mobile Phone Brightness:
1. Exceeding Maximum Brightness Limit: Test if the application allows brightness to exceed the maximum level and if it handles this situation gracefully (e.g., error message or ignored action).
2. Dropping Below Minimum Brightness: Check if the system allows brightness to drop below the visible level, which could lead to a completely black screen.
3. Auto-Brightness in Total Darkness: Test auto-brightness functionality in complete darkness to ensure the brightness doesn't remain too high or fail to adjust to a dim state.
4. Brightness Adjustment During Power Saver Mode: Try adjusting the brightness while in power saver mode and verify if any restrictions apply or the system prevents certain actions (e.g., preventing max brightness to save power).
